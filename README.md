🌐 Static Resume Website with Visitor Counter — AWS + Terraform + CI/CD


📜 Overview
This project demonstrates a fully automated static resume website, deployed on AWS, with a real-time visitor counter — using serverless technologies, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and CI/CD pipelines.

The site is served securely over HTTPS, uses a custom domain, and is built using:

AWS S3 (static site hosting)

CloudFront (CDN + SSL)

Route 53 (DNS)

API Gateway + Lambda (Visitor Counter API)

DynamoDB (visitor count store)

Terraform (IaC)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Live site: https://autocloudmate.com


✅ Static Resume Website with custom design
✅ Real-time Visitor Counter with Serverless API
✅ Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
✅ HTTPS with CloudFront and SSL
✅ Custom domain with Route 53
✅ Terraform-managed infrastructure
✅ GitHub Actions for auto-deploy
✅ Serverless, scalable, and low-cost

⚙️ Tech Stack
Component	Technology
Hosting	AWS S3
CDN + HTTPS	AWS CloudFront
DNS	AWS Route 53
API	AWS API Gateway
Backend (Serverless)	AWS Lambda (Python + boto3)
Database	DynamoDB (on-demand)
IaC	Terraform
CI/CD	GitHub Actions
Security	GitHub Secrets, IAM roles

🌍 Website Workflow
Visitor opens the site: CloudFront serves static content from S3

Frontend JS triggers /visitor API via API Gateway

Lambda updates and fetches visitor count from DynamoDB

Result is displayed on the site dynamically

🛠️ Infrastructure as Code
Infrastructure is fully automated using Terraform (infra/main.tf), including:

S3 Bucket (existing)

CloudFront cache invalidation

Serverless API + Lambda + DynamoDB

Variables and reusability for multi-region support

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions automates:

✅ Terraform apply
✅ S3 sync (HTML, CSS, JS upload)
✅ CloudFront cache invalidation

Workflow: .github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml

On every push to main:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- terraform init
- terraform apply
- aws s3 sync . s3://autocloudmate --delete
- aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E37CM87UA02ZMU --paths "/*"
AWS credentials are securely stored in GitHub Secrets.

📈 Visitor Counter
The visitor counter API is built with:

AWS Lambda (Python)

DynamoDB (stores count)

API Gateway (serves endpoint /visitor)

JavaScript frontend (AJAX calls to API)

Simple, lightweight, and serverless — with potential for future features: IP-based counting, session tracking, geo-location analytics.

💡 What This Project Demonstrates
✅ Core AWS Services proficiency
✅ Serverless application development
✅ DevOps CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
✅ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
✅ Secure, automated deployments
✅ Real-world use of AWS Free Tier
✅ Cloud cost optimization practices

📝 How to Deploy This Project
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-resume-site.git
cd aws-resume-site
Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
Push your changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deploy"
git push origin main
Done! The pipeline runs automatically on GitHub Actions and your live site updates.

🔐 Security Best Practices
AWS credentials are never hard-coded

GitHub Secrets used in workflows

S3 bucket restricted to CloudFront origin only

HTTPS enforced via CloudFront

No manual console deployments — fully IaC

🔮 Possible Improvements
Migrate Terraform state to S3 backend with locking

Add unit tests to Lambda (pytest)

Use CloudWatch for detailed Lambda metrics

Support multiple environments (prod/stage)

Add pre-prod preview deployment using GitHub Pages
